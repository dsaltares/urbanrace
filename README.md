Urban Race is a time attack racing game developed using the C# language using the Microsoft XNA library.
Currently it works under Windows systems but it could potentially be easily ported to the Xbox 360
game console.

It was written in over a month as an assignment for the Advanced Games Programming module at Kingston
University London.
