% Conclusion

From my point of view, I think that \game\ covers every requirement for this
Advanced Games Programming module. It is a 3D game with terrain, dynamic sound,
simple physics, user interface, level creation, collision detection, and many
more features.\\

However, I also believe that the game could be improved by adding some of the
following features.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Terrain quadtree implementation to improve performance.
	\item More tracks and a wider range of game objects like buildings or environments.
	\item Particle effects to show tire smoke and crashing effects.
	\item Xbox 360 and Windows Phone 7 total support. The current code is multiplatform
	but it needs testing. I do not have access to neither platforms from home so that has
	been a difficulty factor.
	\item Motion blur effect to enhance the speed feeling.
	\item Race against your shadow mode.
\end{enumerate}
